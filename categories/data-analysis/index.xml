      <title>Is the NFL&#39;s Home-Field Advantage Over?</title>

      <description>Introduction Home-field advantage (HFA) has been documented in many sports, and much speculation has covered the potential causal mechanisms (referee bias, travel times, crowd reactions, etc.). In the NFL, historically, playing at home has offered about a three point advantage in the point differential, the equivalent of a field goal. However, with COVID-19 imposed restrictions, many home games were conducted without fans, and the home team&#39;s advantage nearly disappeared.</description>

      <title>Why you shouldn’t “hold-out” data in survival-model predictions</title>

      <description>In nearly all cases, the proper way to make predictions on a subset of your data is by holding-out the data you want to predict, training a model on the remaining data, then predicting the outcome on the held-out data using the trained model. The reason is that this procedure ostensibly captures how you would use this model in practice: train the model on all the data you have, then predict for new data where the outcome is unknown.</description>

      <description>The Project One fateful day while I was bored during a lecture, I decided to sign up for email messages from each Senate campaign during the 2018 election cycle.1 A lot of people study the impact of political advertisements on various outcomes, and I thought some interesting trends might emerge in the email blasts that campaigns send out.
 The Data I signed up using a new email address, and only filled out the required fields to get on mailing lists.</description>

      <description>Introduction Last spring, I took a class on Bayesian statistics at the University of Chicago that had several exercises focused on building a model to classify species based on their genome. The basic setup was that you were given a data set of salmon, their genome sequencing data, and which sub-population they belonged to. From this data, we needed to build a model to classify new salmon into the sub-populations.</description>
