      <title>Why you shouldn’t “hold-out” data in survival-model predictions</title>

      <description>In nearly all cases, the proper way to make predictions on a subset of your data is by holding-out the data you want to predict, training a model on the remaining data, then predicting the outcome on the held-out data using the trained model. The reason is that this procedure ostensibly captures how you would use this model in practice: train the model on all the data you have, then predict for new data where the outcome is unknown.</description>

      <description>I came across two articles recently that I thought spoke to each other in an interesting way. The first was a New York Times piece about the failings of data science firms who try to identify school shootings before they happen by social media posts. The second was a Vox article about how a crisis counseling hotline successfully used data science to flag callers who are at higher risk of suicide or self-harm.</description>

      <description>Introduction I recently encountered a problem that had a surprisingly elegant solution. I struggled a lot with solving this issue, so hopefully in writing this post I can save someone else the trouble! For reasons that are irrelevant, I wanted to track the performance of youth fencers across time. National ranking lists are posted each year, but the fencers’ names frequently change from year to year. My solution was to create a dataset of all sets of two names, mark which pairs were matches, then pick a single name to use for each set of names that matched against each other.</description>
