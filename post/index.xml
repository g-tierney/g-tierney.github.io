      <description>This is my second article round up. The first is over at my old blog here. In this post, I’ll briefly cover two Atlantic articles related to economic inequality and the differing economic expectations of democrats and republicans.

      <description>IntroductionLast spring, I took a class on Bayesian statistics at the University of Chicago that had several exercises focused on building a model to classify species based on their genome. The basic setup was that you were given a data set of salmon, their genome sequencing data, and which sub-population they belonged to. From this data, we needed to build a model to classify new salmon into the sub-populations. The strategy was to use the fact that alleles appeared with different frequencies in the different sub-populations, so the fact that a new fish did have certain alleles and did not have others was informative about which sub-population it came from.</description>
