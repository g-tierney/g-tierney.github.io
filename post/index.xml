      <title>Is the NFL&#39;s Home-Field Advantage Over?</title>

      <description>Introduction Home-field advantage (HFA) has been documented in many sports, and much speculation has covered the potential causal mechanisms (referee bias, travel times, crowd reactions, etc.). In the NFL, historically, playing at home has offered about a three point advantage in the point differential, the equivalent of a field goal. However, with COVID-19 imposed restrictions, many home games were conducted without fans, and the home team&#39;s advantage nearly disappeared.</description>

      <title>Why you shouldn’t “hold-out” data in survival-model predictions</title>

      <description>In nearly all cases, the proper way to make predictions on a subset of your data is by holding-out the data you want to predict, training a model on the remaining data, then predicting the outcome on the held-out data using the trained model. The reason is that this procedure ostensibly captures how you would use this model in practice: train the model on all the data you have, then predict for new data where the outcome is unknown.</description>

      <title>What About the Emails?</title>

      <description>The Project One fateful day while I was bored during a lecture, I decided to sign up for email messages from each Senate campaign during the 2018 election cycle.1 A lot of people study the impact of political advertisements on various outcomes, and I thought some interesting trends might emerge in the email blasts that campaigns send out.
 The Data I signed up using a new email address, and only filled out the required fields to get on mailing lists.</description>

      <title>Reviews: The Book of Why and Bad Blood</title>

      <description>Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect I was honestly surprised by how much I liked this book. It covers Pearl’s new work on causal diagrams, directed graphs where each node represents a variable and edges point in the direction of the causal effect. His claim is that these graphs make previously “squishy” arguments about identification mathematically robust, simplify many hard-to-explain causal concepts, and will be useful in building strong artificial intelligence because the graphs are machine-readable, unlike other causal identifying assumptions.</description>

      <title>Data Science in Mental Health</title>

      <description>I came across two articles recently that I thought spoke to each other in an interesting way. The first was a New York Times piece about the failings of data science firms who try to identify school shootings before they happen by social media posts. The second was a Vox article about how a crisis counseling hotline successfully used data science to flag callers who are at higher risk of suicide or self-harm.</description>

      <description>Introduction I recently encountered a problem that had a surprisingly elegant solution. I struggled a lot with solving this issue, so hopefully in writing this post I can save someone else the trouble! For reasons that are irrelevant, I wanted to track the performance of youth fencers across time. National ranking lists are posted each year, but the fencers’ names frequently change from year to year. My solution was to create a dataset of all sets of two names, mark which pairs were matches, then pick a single name to use for each set of names that matched against each other.</description>

      <title>Article Round Up June 2018: Income Inequality, Partisan Economies, and Trump Tweets to Hate Crimes</title>

      <description>This is my second article round up. The first is over at my old blog here. In this post, I’ll briefly cover two Atlantic articles related to economic inequality and the differing economic expectations of democrats and republicans. Most time is spent reviewing a new working paper on the correlation between Trump’s twitter activity and hate crimes, and thinking about how it could make the jump from correlation to causation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Last spring, I took a class on Bayesian statistics at the University of Chicago that had several exercises focused on building a model to classify species based on their genome. The basic setup was that you were given a data set of salmon, their genome sequencing data, and which sub-population they belonged to. From this data, we needed to build a model to classify new salmon into the sub-populations.</description>
