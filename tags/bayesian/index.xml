      <description>IntroductionLast spring, I took a class on Bayesian statistics at the University of Chicago that had several exercises focused on building a model to classify species based on their genome. The basic setup was that you were given a data set of salmon, their genome sequencing data, and which sub-population they belonged to. From this data, we needed to build a model to classify new salmon into the sub-populations. The strategy was to use the fact that alleles appeared with different frequencies in the different sub-populations, so the fact that a new fish did have certain alleles and did not have others was informative about which sub-population it came from.</description>
