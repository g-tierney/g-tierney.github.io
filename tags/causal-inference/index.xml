      <description>Judea Pearle’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect I was honestly surprised by how much I liked this book. It covers Pearle’s new work on causal diagrams, directed graphs were each node represents a variable and edges point in the direction of the causal effect. His claim is that these graphs make previously “squishy” arguments about identification mathematically robust, simplify many hard-to-explain causal concepts, and will be useful in building strong artificial intelligence because the graphs are machine-readable, unlike other causal identifying assumptions.</description>
