      <description>Introduction I recently encountered a problem that had a surprisingly elegant solution. I struggled a lot with solving this issue, so hopefully in writing this post I can save someone else the trouble! For reasons that are irrelevant, I wanted to track the performance of youth fencers across time. National ranking lists are posted each year, but the fencersâ€™ names frequently change from year to year. My solution was to create a dataset of all sets of two names, mark which pairs were matches, then pick a single name to use for each set of names that matched against each other.</description>
